# AISOR
This project allows you to secure an RDP session using SSH session.
AISOR-SERVER transfers the RDP port from a real machine to a virtual machine using nginx(stream).

AiSOR-CLIENT connects the virtual machine to the SSH server and forwards the RDP port locally to your machine.

I have tried to implement compatibility with several Linux distributions including Arch, Debian, Fedora.


The guide is made near-automatic using ip address for Virtualbox virtual machines
